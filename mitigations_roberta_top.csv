T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"Anti-virus can also automatically quarantine suspicious files | Enable auditing and monitoring for email attachments and file transfers to detect and investigate suspicious activity. Regularly review logs for anomalies related to attachments containing potentially malicious content, as well as any attempts to execute or interact with these files. This practice helps identify spearphishing attempts before they can lead to further compromise | Network intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious email attachments can be used to block activity | Block unknown or unused attachments by default that should not be transmitted over email as a best practice to prevent some vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc. Some email scanning devices can open and analyze compressed and encrypted formats, such as zip and rar that may be used to conceal malicious attachments | Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing | Apply user account management principles to limit permissions for accounts interacting with email attachments, ensuring that only necessary accounts have the ability to open or execute files.

Additionally, users may perform visual checks of the domains they visit; however, homographs in ASCII and in IDN domains and URL schema obfuscation may render manual checks difficult.

Phishing training and other cybersecurity training may raise awareness to check URLs before visiting the sites"
T1566.003,Spearphishing via Service,"Anti-virus can also automatically quarantine suspicious files | Implement auditing and logging for interactions with third-party messaging services or collaboration platforms. Monitor user activity and review logs for signs of suspicious links, downloads, or file exchanges that could indicate spearphishing attempts. Effective auditing allows for the quick identification of malicious activity originating from compromised service accounts | Determine if certain social media sites, personal webmail services, or other service that can be used for spearphishing is necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk | Enforce strict user account management policies on third-party service accounts to control access and limit privileges.
